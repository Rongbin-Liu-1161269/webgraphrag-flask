Initially, Scrooge is depicted as a solitary figure, disengaged from social interactions and devoid of any generosity. However, as the story progresses, he undergoes a significant change of heart.

By the end of the narrative, Scrooge evolves from his miserly ways to a state of generosity and warmth.

His change is most evident in his relationship with his employee, Bob Cratchit, and Cratchit's family, particularly Tiny Tim, whom Scrooge comes to treat as if he were a second father.
